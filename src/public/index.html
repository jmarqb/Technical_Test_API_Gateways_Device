    <h1>API REST TECHNICIAN TEST</h1>

    <p>
        This sample project is managing gateways - master devices that control multiple peripheral devices.
        Your task is to create a REST service (JSON/HTTP) for storing information about these gateways and
         their associated devices. This information must be stored in the database. 
        When storing a gateway, any field marked as “to be validated” must be validated and an error 
        returned if it is invalid. Also, no more that 10 peripheral devices are allowed for a gateway.
        The service must also offer an operation for displaying information about all stored gateways 
        (and their devices) and an operation for displaying details for a single gateway. 
        Finally, it must be possible to add and remove a device from a gateway.
    </p>

    <p>
        Each gateway has:
        a unique serial number (string), 
        human-readable name (string),
        IPv4 address (to be validated),
        multiple associated peripheral devices. 
        Each peripheral device has:
        a UID (number),
        vendor (string),
        date created,
        status - online/offline.
        Other considerations
        Please, provide 
        Basic UI - recommended or providing test data for Postman (or other rest client) if you do not have enough time.
        Meaningful Unit tests.
        Readme file with installation guides.
        An automated build.
